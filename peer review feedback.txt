/*General Overview:
	Overall, this is some good code in my opinion.  For the most part,
the only real issue is readability.  Certain sections feel hard to read and 
could use with a bit of clean up and commenting.  Also, be careful with your 
naming conventions.  Certain variable names seem hard to understand or remember what 
they represent.  Besides that, good job. You've put in a lot of work.
